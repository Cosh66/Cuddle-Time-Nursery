- ## bugs
- I found that I could not do the hamburger menu, so I tried ChatGPT for help, but did not like how it was presented on my site.
- Watch youtube, copid on to my website, again did not work with my website.
- I have managed to make a hamburger menu that is not active.
- The more I messed with the hamburger menu, it was messing up my website.
